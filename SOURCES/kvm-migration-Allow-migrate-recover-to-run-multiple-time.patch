RH-MergeRequest: 104: migration: Allow migrate-recover to run multiple times
RH-Commit: [1/1] afd726e54c069ae800e2d01f34e768d6bac7dcb9 (peterx/qemu-kvm)

Previously migration didn't have an easy way to cleanup the listening
transport, migrate recovery only allows to execute once.  That's done with a
trick flag in postcopy_recover_triggered.

Now the facility is already there.

Drop postcopy_recover_triggered and instead allows a new migrate-recover to
release the previous listener transport.
